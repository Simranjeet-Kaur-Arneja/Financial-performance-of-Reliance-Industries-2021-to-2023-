***Financial Performance of Reliance Industries-Power BI**
About this project

 🎯 Objective:
The primary goal of this project was to evaluate the financial performance of Reliance Industry by creating a comprehensive dashboard. The process involved a comprehensive approach, from data cleaning to generating insights.

🔍 Data Import & Transformation
Starting with importing diverse datasets into Power BI, I utilized Power Query to clean, transform, and ensure the data was ready for analysis. This crucial step involved handling missing values, merging datasets, and creating calculated columns.

📊 Building Analytical Models with DAX
Using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), I created advanced measures and calculations to delve into key metrics using Balance sheets, Profit/Loss and Cash flow statements from the year 2020 to 2023.

📈 Visualization & Interaction
I designed dynamic charts, graphs, and tables, ensuring they were not only visually appealing but also highly interactive. Filters and slicers were incorporated to allow users to drill down into specific data points, making the dashboard highly customizable.

📋 Dashboard Setup & Export
The final step was setting up this Dashboard in Power BI. It was structured to provide clear, at-a-glance insights, with the ability to export the dashboard for reporting and presentations. 

🔗 Key Insights
The dashboard provided key insights about the financial performance of Reliance Industries Ltd. over the years.
